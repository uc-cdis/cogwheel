# FOR ENABLING INTERACTIVE DEBUGGER (Uncomment to enable)
# In debug mode, since the WSGI app cannot run in daemon mode, it must
# be run in embedded mode, and the venv is specified via the WSGIPythonHome
# directive (instead of the WSGIDaemonProcess directive),
# outside the VirtualHost definition. See docs:
